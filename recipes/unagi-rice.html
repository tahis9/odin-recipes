    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>‘Unagi’ is the Japanese word for ‘eel’, and this particular one-bowl donburi dish tops servings of white rice with fillets of freshly grilled eel, all seasoned with a homemade unagi sauce. Prepare on the barbecue during a hot summer’s day, or make on an oven grill in the evening.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>unagi sauce:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>2 ½ tbsp sugar</li>
          <li>1 ½ tbsp cooking sake</li>
          <li>4 tbsp soy sauce</li>
          <li>4 tbsp mirin</li>
        </ul>
      <li>200g rice</li>
      <li>260ml water</li>
      <li>2 eel fillets, skin-on</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Make the sauce:</strong> Combine the 4 tbsp mirin and 1 ½ tbsp cooking sake in a small saucepan and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and add the 2 ½ tbsp sugar, stirring until completely dissolved. Add the 4 tbsp soy sauce and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 mins, or until the sauce thickens. Turn off the heat and set aside to cool.</li>
      <li><strong>Prepare the rice:</strong> While the sauce is cooling, start cooking and preparing the rice using your preferred method. We suggest using 200g rice and 260ml water after washing the rice.</li>
      <li><strong>Grill the unagi:</strong> Preheat your grilling unit to high (about 250°C). Normally eel fillets come sliced in half lengthwise, so cut your 2 eel fillets in half width-wise so they can fit on top of your rice bowl. Line a baking sheet with aluminium foil. Lay the fillets on top and brush with vegetable oil. Place on the grilling unit and grill for 5-7 minutes, or until nicely browned.</li>
      <li><strong>Add the unagi sauce:</strong> Take the fillets out of the oven and carefully brush with the unagi sauce, leaving a little sauce for later. Place the fillets back on the grilling unit to grill for a further minute or so, until the sauce starts to bubble on top.</li>
      <li><strong>Serve and enjoy:</strong> To serve, Add a serving of cooked rice to an empty bowl. Brush the top of the rice with the remaining sauce and lay the unagi fillets on top.</li>
    </ol>
